I made this Habit Tracker for my wife where she can add the habits and track them in a calendar. She can also see her stats in the past  and 30 days. 
I built it in Kotlin with:
- Jetpack Compsoe
- Room database
- Hilt for dependencies injection
- MVVM architecture

As I used the Calpose library for the calendar, it only works on SDK 26+
